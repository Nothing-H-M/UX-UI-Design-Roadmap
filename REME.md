# Distinguishing Between UI and UX
Simple definition:

- When people say __UI__, they usually mean everything related to graphic design, colors, fonts, backgrounds, buttons, stock photos, icons etc.
- When people say __UX__, they usually mean tasks related to psychology, human decision making, user research, personas, user stories, workflows, A/B testing, statistical evaluation and so on.

## ðŸŽ¨ User Interface Designer Roadmap

User Interface (UI) design is the process of creating the visual elements and interactive features of a digital product, such as a website, mobile app, or software application. The primary goal of UI design is to enhance the user's experience by making the product visually appealing, easy to use, and efficient in achieving its purpose. UI design encompasses various elements that users interact with on the screen, including buttons, icons, images, text, forms, and other interactive components.
The tools of the trade for UI design are mainly [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), [Adobe XD](http://www.adobe.com/de/products/experience-design.html), [Adobe Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/de/products/photoshop.html) and [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/de/products/illustrator.html). Some UI designers also code HTML and CSS at work.

The goal of UX design is to enhance user satisfaction and usability by improving the overall interaction between the user and the product. Here's a general roadmap for UX design:

# Course: User Experience for Web Design
## Course details
Whether you're designing anything from a personal blog site or portfolio to an ecommerce website, always keep in mind: A good user experience will make users stay on your site, while a bad one will make them look elsewhere. In this course, Chris Nodder teaches you how to apply some simple interaction design principles to your site to make it behave in the way that users expect and enjoy. Chris covers the key things people want from web sites, how they search for information, how they read online, and how to structure your content to take advantage of this. He shows you how to use graphics to help rather than hinder visitors, how to integrate video, audio, and other media, and when to consider interactive rather than static content. He also discusses the importance of seeing your siteâ€™s home page, forms, product pages and content through usersâ€™ eyes in order to build a site that better meets their needs.
